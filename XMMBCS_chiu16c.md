title: The stellar properties of X-ray clusters
mathjax: true
---

The stellar properties (i.e., the total stellar mass $M_{\star}$ and the fraction of blue galaxies $f_{\mathrm{blue}}$) of 46 X-ray selected clusters 
in the [XMM-BCS][suhada12] survey were studied with the [Blanco Cosmology Survey (BCS; Desai+12)][desai12] and the [Spitzer South Pole Telescope Deep Field (SSDF; Ashby+13)][ashby13] in [Chiu+16c][chiu16c].
As presented in Table 1, the measurements of the stellar properties, selected X-ray measurements, and the total halo mass can be downloaded [here][chiu16ctable].
The table reads

| Column 	| Context |
| :------ |:--- |
| xbcs_id | The cluster ID     	|
| redshift, redshift\_err    		| The cluster redshift |
| Lxbol, Lxbol\_err 				| The bolometric X-ray luminosity in erg/s |
| Tx, Tx\_err                 	| The X-ray temperature in $k$eV |
| r500        						| The cluster radius $R_{500}$ in $k$pc |
| m500, m500\_err    			   | The halo mass $M_{500}$ in $M_{\odot}$ |
| mstar, mstar\_err   		       | The total stellar mass in $M_{\odot}$ |
| phistar, phistar\_err          | The normalization of the luminosity function in $L_{\odot}^{-1}$    |
| fblue, fblue\_err              | The fraction of blue galaxies with respect to total galaxies members |
