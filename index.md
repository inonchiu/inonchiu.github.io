My research interests lie in the field of observational cosmology and astrophysics with a focus on utilizing galaxy clusters as a probe.
I am also highly interested in astro-statistics, high-performance computing, and data science in general.

I am an Assistant Professor in Department of Physics at [National Cheng Kung University (NCKU)][ncku] in [Tainan][tainan], [Taiwan][taiwan].
Before 2022, I was an independent postdoc at [Tsung-Dao Lee Institute (TDLI)][tdli] and [Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)][sjtu] in Shanghai, China.
Before that, I was a postdoc at [Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics (ASIAA)][asiaa] during 2016 and 2020.
I obtained my PhD at [Ludwig Maximilians University (LMU)][lmu] in 2016.
Before moving to Munich, I studied my Master Degree in Astrophysics at [National Taiwan University (NTU)][ntu] and [ASIAA][asiaa].
