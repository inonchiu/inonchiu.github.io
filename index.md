Hello, I am an astrophysicist and cosmologist from [Taiwan][taiwan].
I was born and raised in Taipei, Taiwan.
Welcome to my webpage.

My research interests lie in the field of observational cosmology and astrophysics with a focus on utilizing galaxy clusters as a probe.
I am also highly interested in astro-statistics, high-performance computing, and data science in general.

In the winter semester of 2022, I will join Department of Physics at [National Cheng Kung University (NCKU)][ncku] in [Tainan][tainan] as an Assistant Professor.
Currently, I am an independent postdoc at [Tsung-Dao Lee Institute (TDLI)][tdli] and [Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)][sjtu] in Shanghai, China.
Before that, I was a postdoc working with Prof. [Keiichi Umetsu][keiichi] and Prof. [Teppei Okumura][teipei]
at [Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics (ASIAA)][asiaa] during 2016 and 2020.
I obtained my PhD under the supervision of Prof. Dr. [Joseph Mohr][mohr] at [Ludwig Maximilians University (LMU)][lmu] in 2016.
Before moving to Munich, I studied my Master Degree in [National Taiwan University (NTU)][ntu] and [ASIAA][asiaa] working with
Prof. [Sandor Molnar][sandor] and Prof. [Pisin Chen][pisin].
